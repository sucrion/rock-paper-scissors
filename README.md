# Rock, Paper, Scissors
This is a site for playing rock, paper, scissors against a computer. A game lasts until either the player or the computer reaches 5 points.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This began with practicing functions before being turned into a full, useable page with interactive UI elements. 

## Optimizations

The bulk of the improvements would be on the aesthetic side. Though functional, the page could certainly be prettier. It could also show an additional score showing the total games won (beyond the score of the current game).

## Lessons Learned:

This project helped me get more comfortable with branching on Git, as the UI work was done on a separate branch before being merged. It also helped me get more used to integrating JavaScript functionality at multiple levels (on click with buttons, changing text with the running score, showing text once conditions are met, etc).
